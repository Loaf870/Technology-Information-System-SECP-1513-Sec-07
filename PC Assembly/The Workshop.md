I have overviewed the what's known as a computer hardware during PC Assemble Workshop, in UTM Johor. Our task was to reassemble and assemble the hardware components such as hard disc, Random Access Memory (RAM), power supply, and more. At the upmost right part, it is known as "Power Supply". It is the powerhouse of the whole computer hardware and is vital for all components to function.

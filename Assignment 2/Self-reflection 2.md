### Assignment 2: Reflection
---
The talk offered a glimpse to students on how ICT plays a major role in sustaining and growing multinational companies such
as PPG. ICT professionals, including data analysts, data scientist and cloud engineers build and maintain a company’s global
infrastructure that enables all business operations where they transform raw data into actionable strategic insights and they
implement critical security measures to protect valuable assets and ensure business continuity. By driving innovation, optimizing
workflows, and facilitating global communication, ICT roles move beyond simple support to become strategic necessities that
determine a company's competitive advantage and future growth across every sector. This session definitely brought
motivation towards students to be innovative, precisive and problem solvers when they embrace ICT roles in the future.

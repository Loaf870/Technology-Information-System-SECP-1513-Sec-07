The visit was astonishing! When I first entered the entrance of the UTMdigital center, I was gifted by a simple notebook by answering one of their booths survey about the feedbacks from UTM students.
And then I stumbled upon D-RON booth that featured many types of camera. I got hooked by the body camera! It costed like above RM4000 because how durable the device was.
This brought me an insight view on IT jobs industry, I wonder if I could build my own prototype with enough IT knowledge one day.

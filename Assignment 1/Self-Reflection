I interviewed a UTMdigital employee! What view I had was becoming myself as sort of a news reporter too. I’ve also gained a knowledge that the employee is sort of the network connection manager on Wi-Fi functions. My point of view is that we have to be appreciative on how we use the Wi-Fi because managing Internet Protocol isn’t easy as network engineer.

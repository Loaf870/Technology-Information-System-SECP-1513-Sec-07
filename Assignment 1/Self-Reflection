I interviewed a UTMdigital employee! What view I had was becoming myself as sort of a news reporter too.
I’ve also gained a knowledge that the employee is sort of the network connection manager on Wi-Fi
functions. My point of view is that we have to be appreciative on how we use the Wi-Fi because managing
Internet Protocol isn’t easy as network engineer. My group and myself also went to D-Ron booth just to
witness the magnificent creation of many types of camera! I got hooked by body camera, its function is to
capture everything infront of it in real-time. it costed for like RM 4500 due to its extreme durability
so whenever reckless accident occurs, it won't broke easily. Now I know why the devices sold were a big
deal. Therefore, made me realized how much respect I could give for the IT engineers out there to build this body camera.

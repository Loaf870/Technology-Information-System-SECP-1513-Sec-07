They explained about network that had both wired and wireless like fiber network covers roughly 50 kilometers of JohorPort itself. The company also provided cybersecurity awareness every year to monitor data department safely.

Mr. Taufiq, the project manager taught me about not blaming others because it won't make any progress. For him having strong faith and hope are vital which also applied to everyone.

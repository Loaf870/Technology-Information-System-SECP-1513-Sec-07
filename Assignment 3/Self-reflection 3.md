### Assignment 3: Reflection
---
After the presentation made by Ts. Hj. Abdul Halim bin Abdul Muttalib, I just realized that most people do know how to code,
but don’t know how to implement their projects. One reason why the system development have declined is that it is not just a chapter in their program, instead
a core language for their future careers. I need the system design skills in my life where I would develop one design architecture that must be planned on how
it is about to be executed. Lastly, there was this catchphrase that Abdul Halim taught for me, "If you really wanna focus on computer science, don't stop learning."
This showed me a big motivation where I will never stop learning the art of computer science.

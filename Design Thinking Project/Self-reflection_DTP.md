### Design Thinking Project: Reflection
---
Our design thinking project gave me some perspective on how to put
yourself into customer reviews. My main role was providing questions to clarify
user’s problems giving their opinions on our current system we have through Google
form. We then received important feedback which helped our project design better.
After that, we concluded that a biometric facial system is essential to be implemented
instead. This really helps me improve on my data analyzing skills and my
advertisement overview. In the future, I would finally find myself important to be a
part of a company’s group project; team leadership as we can’t work alone all the time
as human beings. Therefore, I can give my own responsibilities toward an industry
that is looking for a game developer, web designer or graphic designer.
